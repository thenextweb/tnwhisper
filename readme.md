# TNWhisper 🤖

## NOTE: this is a work in progress! ⚠️

#### This is a custom Slackbot for TNW's employees to share and collect feedback completely anonymously, powered by GPT. The tool collects all feedback via Slack, sends them anonymously to GPT, and returns a single text summary of them all. Useful to get a quick feeling of the team's general mood.

## Setup
Copy the content of `config.js.sample` into a separate `config.js` file, in the root of the project. Add your own channel names and settings.

Initiate the project with `npm install`, then run it with `npm start`.
