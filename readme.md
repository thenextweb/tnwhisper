## NOTE: this is a work in progress! ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### This is a custom Slackbot for TNW's employees to share and collect feedback completely anonymously, powered by GPT. The tool collects all feedback via Slack, sends them anonymously to GPT, and returns a single text summary of them all. Useful to get a quick feeling of the team's general mood.

## Setup
Initiate the project with `npm install`, then run it with `npm start`. 
Settings can be changed in the `config.js` file.
