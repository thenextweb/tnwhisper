# TNWhisper ü§ñ

## NOTE: this is a work in progress! ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### This is a custom Slackbot for TNW's employees to share and collect feedback completely anonymously, powered by GPT. The tool collects all feedback via Slack, sends them anonymously to GPT, and returns a single text summary of them all. Useful to get a quick feeling of the team's general mood.

## Setup
Copy the content of `config.js.sample` into a separate `config.js` file, in the root of the project. Add your own channel names and settings.

You'll also have to duplicate the .env.sample file, and add your own Slack tokens and GPT API key.

Initiate the project with `npm install`, then run it with `npm start`.
